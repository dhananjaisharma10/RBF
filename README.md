# Underwater Network Routing Protocol

This is an implementation of an underwater acoustic sensor network routing protocol as given in [R. H. Rahman, C. Benson, and M. Frater, "Routing protocols for underwater ad hoc networks," IEEE Oceans, 2012](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6263636).

The protocol is implemented in [UnetStack](https://unetstack.net) in Groovy.
